# module5_challenge

When going through the assignment, I referred to Stack Overflow and ChatGPT when I had questions. From Stack Overflow I found information that led to me using the .duplicated() and .drop_duplicates() in lines 163 through 165. In the "Line and Scatter Plots" section I sought advice from ChatGPT to find my variables and ended up using the suggestion of building a dataframe from one mouse's data and then pulling the "Timepoint" and "Tumor Volume (mm3)" columns from that.
